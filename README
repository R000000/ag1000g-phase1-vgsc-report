---- run data notebooks first in the following order

data_phasing_extra_phase1.ipynb - uses mvncall to phase two multiallelics and N1570Y SNP filtered out of PASS dataset

data_combined_haplotypes.ipynb - combines the haplotype data with extras phased by mvncall

data_variants_phase1.ipynb - extracts data on all VGSC mutations

data_misc.ipynb - brings some small data files directly into Git repo


---- run the following three artwork notebooks next in this order - they generate some data files used later

artwork_hierarchical_cluster_vgsc.ipynb - perform hierarchical clustering based on technique used in Ag1000g Nature paper and produces figure

artwork_median_joining_networks.ipynb - performs median joining network analysis and produces figures

artwork_ehh_decay_final.ipynb - performs ehh analysis using hierarchical clustering haplotype clusters


---- once the above have been run the following notebooks can then be run in any order

artwork_hapfreq_map.ipynb - generates network cluster map artwork

supp_tables.ipynb - generates supplementary data tables

artwork_assay_design.ipynb -  analyses number of SNPs required in genetic assay to define haplotype groups and generates figure



----@@TO DO


analyse_moving_haplotype_homozygosity - doesn't use the haps_phase1.npz, needs updating
analyse_Dxy_using_ag1k_clusters - doesn't use the haps_phase1.npz, needs updating
